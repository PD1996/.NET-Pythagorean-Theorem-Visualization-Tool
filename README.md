## How is it used?
Press the "+" or "-" buttons to add or subtract from the "A" and "B" sides of the triangle. The hypotenuse ("C") as well as the subsequent squares of all sides will be drawn automatically as you do this. To add to that, the length of each side and the area of each square will be calculated on the side.
